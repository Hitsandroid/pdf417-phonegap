/**
 Overlay View Controller is an abstract class for all overlay views placed on top PhotoPay's 
    Camera View Controller.
 
 It's responsibility is to provide meaningful and useful interface for the user to interact with.
 
 Typical actions which need to be allowed to the user are:
 
 - intuitive and meaniningful way to guide the user through scanning process. 
    This is usually done by presenting a "viewfinder" in which the user need to place the scanned object
 - a way to cancel the scanining, typically with a "cancel" or "back" button
 - a way to power on and off the light (i.e. "torch") button
 
 PhotoPay always provides it's own default implementation of the Overlay View Controller for 
 every specific use. Your implementation should closely mimic the default implementation as 
 it's the result of thorough testing with end users. Also, it closely matches the underlying 
 scanning technology.
 
 For example, the scanning technology usually gives results very fast after the user places 
 the device's camera in the expected way above the scanned object. This means a progress bar 
 for the scan is not particularly useful to the user. The majority of time the user spends 
 on positioning the device's camera correctly. That's just an example which demonstrates careful 
 decision making behind default camera overlay view.
 
 ### Initialization
 
 To use your custom overlay with PhotoPay's camera view, you must subclass PPOverlayViewController 
 and specify it when initializing CameraViewController:
 
    PPCameraOverlayViewController *overlayViewController =
        [[PPCameraOverlayViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"PPCameraOverlayViewController" bundle:nil];
 
    // Create camera view controller
    UIViewController *cameraViewController =
        [coordinator cameraViewControllerWithDelegate:self overlayViewController:overlayViewController];
 
 Note: if you create camera view controller without specifying overlay view, the default overlay implementation will be used:
 
    // Create camera view controller
    UIViewController *cameraViewController = [coordinator cameraViewControllerWithDelegate:self];
 
 As with any view controller, you are responsible for specifying UI elements and handling their actions.
 Besides that, there are some requirements for interaction with Camera View Controller. See PPOverlayViewController's 
 methods for more details.
 
 ### Handling orientation changes
 
 Camera view controller is always presented in Portrait mode, but nevertheless, your overlay view be presented in 
 the current device orientation. There are two ways to handle orientation changes.
 
 The first, built in way is a simple way to achieve autorotation. Your Overlay View Controller only needs to 
 implement standard UIViewController methods which specify which orientations are supported. For example, to support 
 only landscape orientations, you need to add the following methods to your Overlay View Controller implementation.
 
    - (BOOL)shouldAutorotate {
        return YES;
    }
 
    - (NSUInteger)supportedInterfaceOrientations {
        return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscape;
    }
 
    - (UIInterfaceOrientation)preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation {
        return UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight;
    }
 
    - (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation {
        return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft || 
            interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight);
    }
 
 If `shouldAutorotate` method returns YES, your Overlay View Controller will automatically rotate to
 support all orientations returned by `supportedInterfaceOrientations` method. You are responsible for
 standard iOS techniques (auto-layout or autoresizing masks) to adjust the UI to new device orientation.
 
 The other method gives you full control over the orientation changes. There are orientation handling methods:
 
    - (void)cameraViewController:(id)cameraViewController willRotateToOrientation:(UIDeviceOrientation)orientation;
    - (void)cameraViewController:(id)cameraViewController didRotateToOrientation:(UIDeviceOrientation)orientation;
 
 You can use those methods to fully replace your view hierarchy for the specific device orientation.
 With this approach you have full control over rotation of your views, but you'll need more work to get the
 desired effect. To use this approach, you only need to specify that your view controller doesn't
 want to autorotate (which is also by default):
 
    - (BOOL)shouldAutorotate {
        return NO;
    }
 
 All of PhotoPay's default overlay views are implemented in this way and have custom rotation animations.
 
 ### Steps for providing custom Camera Overlay View
 
 1. Create a subclass of `PPOverlayViewController`. You can use XIB for user interface, 
    or create UI from code.
 
 2. See if there are any events received from `CameraViewController` which you need 
    to handle for your UI hierarchy
 
 3. Implement your view hierarchy.
 
    If you have a Cancel button in your view, don't forget to call `overlayViewControllerWillCloseCamera:` 
    method on overlay's delegate object when cancel is pressed.
 
    If you have Torch button, dont forget to check if Torch should be displayed by using 
    `overlayViewControllerShouldDisplayTorch:` method, and to report new torch state with 
    `overlayViewController:willSetTorch:` method.
 
 4. Handle orientation changes, either by implementing standard UIViewController autorotation 
    metods, or by custom rotation management on rotation events.
